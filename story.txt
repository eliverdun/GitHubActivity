It was late that night. Starship Robot 22930 was on one of it's last delivers of the night before heading into the shop for routine maintance.
But this final delivery at 11:22 PM of beef jerkey and Ben & Jerry's fish food ice cream from Flamingo Run did not go as expected for this
poor little fellow. 22930 decided to take Langdon Street to make this delivery despite being pulled by herds of college students last time, 
but decided to take this risk again. 22930 did not know what was instore for that night.

The moment he pulled out of Gordon's, things started to take a turn for the worst. As 22930 was crossing Dayton street, his flashing
orange visibility light stopped working, causing a near miss with an oncoming pedestrian. Not only was this probably illegal, but it also
automatically limited his speed to 3 mph. This routine journey was going to take 4 times as long (not what you want when you are delivering
ice cream). Then, as he inched his way towards langdon street, 22930 came across his worst nightmare.

He saw what he thought was a gang of misfits coming to flip him over, but alas, it was actually the students who ordered the food. They took the food and thanked him for his service. Having fufilled his task he turned around and drove back to the shop feeling accomplished and fufilled with his life. The end.
