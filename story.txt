It was late that night. Starship Robot 22930 was on one of it's last delivers of the night before heading into the shop for routine maintance.
But this final delivery at 11:22 PM of beef jerkey and Ben & Jerry's fish food ice cream from Flamingo Run did not go as expected for this
poor little fellow. 22930 decided to take Langdon Street to make this delivery despite being pulled by herds of college students last time, 
but decided to take this risk again. 22930 did not know what was instore for that night.
